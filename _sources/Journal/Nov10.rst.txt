After a long time of measuring and researching online, I finally finished the first prototype of the base of the robot -- that is, the plate on which all the eletric components will be mounted on. The design look like this:

For the sake of saving material, I lasercut the prototype on a chip board. To be honest, they look great even if they are only the first prototype. I even started to think about using the lasercutter to make some sort of board game.
