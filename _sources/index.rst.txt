Final Robotics Project for CS450HO. Last updated on |today|

I realized the major difficulty with the Interet now is not finding the information, but to filter information. Information exists everywhere, and it's impossible for a person to go through it. It's not hard to find the right information, but to find the related information. So, a month after the start of this project, I decided to put this table on the top of this journal, though few people will ever find this journal.
