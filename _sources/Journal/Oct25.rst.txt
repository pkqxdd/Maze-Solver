Today I researched a lot about what power source I Need. Here is a list of major devices that is using power


.. csv-table::
    :header: Device, Input Voltage, Input Current, Input USB

    Raspberry Pi, 5-5.5v, 2A, MicroUSB or jumpers
    Arduino Uno, 6-20v, 1A max, USB-B or 2.1mm center positive plug
    2 DC Motors, 6v, "120mA free-run, 1.6A stall each", from motor shield
    Motor Shield, 6-18v, -- , 2.1mm center-positive plug or jumpers

The DC motors will probably not operate at stall current. I assume it will draw about 80% of the stall curent (this is only a random guess.) I also want the robot to operate for at least 10 minutes before I have to recharge the battery.

It is really hard to find a single power source to power the entire system. Voltage higher than 5.5v will damage the RPi, but the motors require 6v power. Besides, the system requires 5A of current to function safely.

Solution 1
----------

The best way I can think of is to use one power bank and one rechargable battery. The power bank can connect to the raspberry pi and the battery connect to the motor shield. The power for arduino will come from the Raspberry Pi via USB cable.

Minimum battery capacity required for the motors:

.. math::

    3.2A \times 10min = 3.2A \times \frac{1}{6}h = 0.533Ah=533mAh

As for the power banks, any random less than 10 dollars power bank can do the job.

Solution 2
----------

Another solution is to use one giant 7.2v LiPo battery to power the entire system, like the `battery for VEX Robotics <http://www.robotmarketplace.com/products/0-276-1491.html>`_ .

.. warning::
    It is possible to reverse power the Raspberry Pi via its GPIO pin. But the voltage must be exactly 5v, or the pin will be damaged.
