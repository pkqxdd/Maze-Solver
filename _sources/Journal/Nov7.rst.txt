I spent most of the time today soldering magnetic encoders to micro gear motors. They are really tiny and hard to solder. I start to feel slightly dizzy after staring at them for about 30 minutes.

Also, I made a prototype of wheels. Sadly, I threw them away the minute I realized they are not the right size without at least taking a picture. I didn't even save the file for the wheels...
