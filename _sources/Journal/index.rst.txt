The Journal
===========

I realized the major difficulty with the Interet now is not finding the information, but to filter information. Information exists everywhere, and it's impossible for a person to go through it. It's not hard to find the right information, but to find the related information. So, a month after the start of this project, I decided to put this table on the top of this journal, though few people will ever find this journal.

.. csv-table::
    :header: Date, Two Words Summary

.. I hope that by the time I finish this project, I say:"The best part is, I journaled everything"
