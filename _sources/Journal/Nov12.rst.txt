I forgot to leave space for the ball caster and the pins for the reflective sensor array in the first prototype. I fixed them, added holes for ziptying the batteries and made new prototypes with acrylics. I'm ready to start to assemble the robot.

By the way, it took 14 minutes 56 seconds to laser cut this piece, which is slighly shorter than the first prototype.
