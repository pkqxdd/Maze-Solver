Today, I figured out the dimension of everything I need to fit on my robot (exclusing wires.) I didn't realize how big the power bank is until I made this image. The pictures of that thing look pretty small on Amazon...

According to my current plan, I will have to make a robot with four layers, which I don't really want to. But I also don't want to make my robot unnecessarily big viewing from top.

There are only a few things I have to place on the bottom layer:

#. Motors and wheels
#. Reflectance sensor array

Everything else can be put anywhere and connected via wires.
