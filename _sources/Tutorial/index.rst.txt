============
The Tutorial
============

I decide to keep both a journal and a tutorial so that when, in the future, people ask me what I did in the fall term of 2017, I have something to show them. I'm aiming to make this a replicable project. For reasonings of my decisions, please refer to the journal part.

.. warning:: This tutorial is not being updated as of now. It appears in the side navigator for technical reasons only.
